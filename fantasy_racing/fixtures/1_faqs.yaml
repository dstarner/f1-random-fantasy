    question: How does it work?
    answer: Each week you play F1 Random Fantasy Racing, you're randomly assigned
      a car number that corresponds to a car racing in the next [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/)
      race. After the race, you earn the number of points that the car scored in the
      real race. The player with the highest number of points at the end of the season
      wins.

    question: So I just click the button and that's it?
    answer: Yes. There is no action required once you've clicked the giant blue button that makes
      your picks. When the race is over, you will be awarded points. Yes. You need to have a Twitter account to play.
      Fortunately, you can create one of those for free on [Twitter.com](https://twitter.com).

    question: How often do I need to make a pick?
    answer: You get one pick each race during the [Formula 1 season](https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2022.html)
      (March through November). You will need to place a new pick each race. Many people place their picks
      immediately following the latest race so they don't forget to make a pick for the next week.

    question: Do I need to know about Formula 1 in order to play?
    answer: No. Anyone with a Twitter account can play, even if you don't like Formula 1. But we recommend you
      watch [Drive to Survive](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890) on Netflix because its _very_ good.

    question: Do I have to sign up for something?
    answer: Nope. There's no registration required. In fact, there's no signing up whatsoever if you have a
      Twitter account. You just press the “Tweet My Pick” button on a race week and you're entered.

    question: How is this different from NASCAR Random Fantasy Racing?
    answer: Well, for starters, this uses the Formula 1 drivers and schedule instead of NASCAR.
      But for real, what [@steveluvender](http://twitter.com/steveluvender) built with
      <randomfantasyracing.com> is pretty neat, and I was a fan & user of the service. My friends
      wanted something similar for Formula 1, and I wanted to see how quickly I could clone something.

    question: How much does it cost to play Random Fantasy Racing?
    answer: It is free to play. Also, there are no ads. Or creepy data collection tactics. Or any other
      kind of BS. Unlike attending a real Formula 1 race, it won't cost you your life savings!

    question: Does the Random Fantasy Racing Twitter app do things that I wouldn't like?
    answer: No. When you approve the app to make your pick, the only thing that happens is your pick
      is tweeted and saved into this website. It doesn't make your account tweet more things, it
      doesn't change your bio, it doesn't make you follow anyone, and I can't read your DMs (nor
      do I want to. BORING!). It only tweets exactly one time when you press the giant blue button
      on f1randomfantasyracing.com to make a pick for each race.

    question: Does Random Fantasy Racing collect my email address and give it to weirdos?
    answer: No. Nobody is ever exposed to your email address and it is not collected. I don't want to email you anyway.
